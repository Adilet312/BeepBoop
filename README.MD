##  _Description_
_Beep Boop program  takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:_
* _Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!_
* _Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!_
* _Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that._
#### _These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,_
* _The number 13 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that._
* _The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop"._
* _The number 32 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that._
## _Specs_
